        About me
      </h2>
      <p> 
        Hi, my name is Derek Rowan. Photography has been my passion for the last four years.
        After a few years of taking photos as a pass-time, through many hours of training
        from my brother who has 12 years of professional photography experience, I 
        decided to follow in his footsteps and make a career of it.
      </p>
      <p>
       I'm an outgoing person, and nothing brings me more joy than capturing
        moments that you and your family can remember for years to come. 
     </p>
      <p>
        Please check out my portfolio for some examples of beautiful memories I've had
        the opportunity to capture so far.
